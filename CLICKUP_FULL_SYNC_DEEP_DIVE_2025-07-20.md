## 1. Overview

This document explains, in detail and with code-backed accuracy, how the `full-sync` process works in the ClickUp Data Collector project. It focuses especially on the logic of data aggregation, showing how data flows from ClickUp to the local SQLite database and how aggregates are calculated.

---

## 2. What Does `full-sync` Do?

The `full-sync` command is an orchestrated process that performs:

1. **User Synchronization:** Fetches all users from ClickUp and updates the local DB.
2. **Task Synchronization (Full):** Fetches all tasks (and subtasks) from a specified ClickUp list, updating the local DB. The `--full-sync` flag ensures ALL tasks are fetched, not just those changed since the last sync.
3. **Aggregation:** Calculates and stores aggregated work time for each parent task, per user, in the `ReportedTaskAggregates` table.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Breakdown

### a) Users Sync
- Runs `node app.js sync-users`.
- Fetches all users from ClickUp API.
- Updates/inserts users into the `Users` table in the local SQLite DB.
- Handles user deactivation/reactivation and updates user details.

### b) Tasks Sync (Full)
- Runs `node app.js sync-tasks --listId <ID> --fullSync`.
- Fetches **all** tasks and subtasks from the specified ClickUp list.
- For each task:
    - Extracts relevant fields (including custom fields such as `IsParent`, `CLIENT 2025`).
    - Determines parent/child relationships.
    - Extracts additional info (e.g., month from task name if parent).
    - Upserts (inserts or updates) each task in the `Tasks` table.
    - Updates task assignees in `TaskAssignees`.
- Updates the `ClickUpLists` table with the new sync timestamp.

### c) Aggregation
- Runs `node app.js generate-aggregates --listId <ID>`.
- For each "Parent" task in the list:
    - Recursively sums up time spent on the parent and all its subtasks.
    - For each assignee, writes an aggregate row in `ReportedTaskAggregates`.
    - Aggregates include: total minutes, seconds, parent task, client, month, and user.

## 4. Data Aggregation Logic (Technical)

### Entry Point:
- File: `src/cli/generateAggregatesCommand.js`
- Function: `handler(argv)`

### Main Steps:
1. **Fetch All Tasks:** Reads all tasks from the `Tasks` table (optionally filtered by listId).
2. **Build Maps:**
    - `tasksMap`: Maps task IDs to task objects for O(1) access.
    - `childrenMap`: Maps parent task IDs to arrays of their children IDs.
3. **Identify Parent Tasks:** Filters tasks where `is_parent_flag` is true.
4. **Recursively Calculate Time:**
    - Uses `calculateTotalTimeRecursive(taskId, tasksMap, childrenMap)`.
    - For each parent, sums its own `time_spent_on_task_ms` and recursively all its children.
5. **Aggregate for Each Assignee:**
    - For each assignee of a parent task, creates an aggregate entry.
    - Aggregates are stored in `ReportedTaskAggregates` (one row per parent/assignee).
6. **Upsert Aggregates:**
    - Uses a transaction to insert or update aggregates (on conflict, merges rows).
7. **Logging:**
    - Writes operation status and summary to `SyncLog`.

#### Example: Recursive Time Calculation
```js
function calculateTotalTimeRecursive(taskId, tasksMap, childrenMap, visitedTasks = new Set()) {
  if (visitedTasks.has(taskId)) return 0;
  visitedTasks.add(taskId);
  const task = tasksMap.get(taskId);
  if (!task) return 0;
  let totalTimeMs = task.time_spent_on_task_ms || 0;
  const childIds = childrenMap.get(taskId) || [];
  for (const childId of childIds) {
    totalTimeMs += calculateTotalTimeRecursive(childId, tasksMap, childrenMap, visitedTasks);
  }
  visitedTasks.delete(taskId);
  return totalTimeMs;
}
```

## 5. Key Functions and Data Flows

- **`fullSyncCommand.js`**: Orchestrates the whole process by running three commands in sequence (users, tasks, aggregates) using `execSync`.
- **`syncTasksCommand.js`**: Handles fetching and upserting tasks, extracting custom fields, and managing parent-child relationships.
- **`generateAggregatesCommand.js`**: Handles aggregation logic, including recursion and DB upserts.

---

## 6. Database Tables Involved

- **Users**: Stores ClickUp user info.
- **Tasks**: Stores all tasks and subtasks, including parent/child links.
- **TaskAssignees**: Links tasks to assigned users.
- **ReportedTaskAggregates**: Stores aggregated work time per parent task, per user, per client, per month.
- **SyncLog**: Logs each sync/aggregate operation with status and summary.

---

## 7. Error Handling & Logging

- Each step logs to console and to the `SyncLog` table.
- On error, updates the log entry with `FAILURE` and error details.
- Uses transactions for DB integrity during aggregation.
- If any step fails, the process is aborted and logs are updated accordingly.

---

## 8. Summary

- The `full-sync` command guarantees that all relevant data from ClickUp is fetched and processed into a clean, aggregated format for reporting.
- Aggregation is robust, recursive, and per-user.
- All operations are logged for traceability.
